# wordpress-dev-university-website
University Fictional Dynamic Website Created with Wordpress, PHP, Javascript. 

This website has been created by leveraging many of the features offered by Wordpress, and the posssiblity to customize every single aspect
of developing through their service. 

At first, a custom theme has been set using an HTML template. The initial "index" page, along with the "blog" and "page" have been
customized independently. 

Moreover, custom post types and custom fields have been created, such as "Events", "Professors", or "Programs". Custom fields, such as
relationships between those custom post types have been added, in order for an user to find the data he is looking for faster through 
these relationships, which are displayed to the user.

A custom Javascript live-search has been created, to help users find relevant content faster. All the JS modules have been created using 
Object-Oriented principles, while the HTTP Requests have been made using the JQuery "getJSON" method. DOM Manipulation has also been 
performed using JQuery.

The WP REST API has been used to interact with available data on the fly, and return relevant results in time.
